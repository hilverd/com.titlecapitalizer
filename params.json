{"name":"Title Capitalizer","tagline":"Capitalize titles according to various styles.","body":"# Title Capitalizer\r\n\r\nTitle Capitalizer is a small web application for capitalizing titles according\r\nto various styles. Titles are analyzed using\r\n[Apache OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) via\r\n[clojure-opennlp](https://github.com/dakrone/clojure-opennlp), and then\r\ncapitalization rules are applied to each token.\r\n\r\nThis is an early release, much still remains to be done.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe application is currently hosted by Heroku at\r\n[titlecapitalizer.com](http://www.titlecapitalizer.com/).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, to start a local web server for development you can either eval\r\n`web_app.clj` from your editor or launch from the command line:\r\n\r\n    $ lein with-profile production trampoline run -m com.titlecapitalizer.view.web-app\r\n\r\n## To Do\r\n\r\n* Make styles editable. Allow users to log in using\r\n  [Friend](https://github.com/cemerick/friend). Set up a PostgreSQL database and\r\n  store users' custom styles there.\r\n\r\n* Allow capitalization styles to be exported and imported to/from text files.\r\n\r\n* In the \"Analyzed\" area show the rules that were matched to each token. Display\r\n  the rule number after the token's POS tag.\r\n\r\n* Add [unit tests](https://github.com/marick/Midje).\r\n\r\n* Add informal documentation.\r\n\r\n* Add documentation about the application's internals.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright Â© 2013 Hilverd Reker.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
